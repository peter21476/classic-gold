        "bio": "Comfortably retired following a lengthy career in the Business Forms Printing Industry, I am now pursuing my first passion – RADIO.  In 1967 I attended the National Institute of Broadcasting, obtaining a certificate of proficiency – but jobs for new announcers were few so I opted for a career in printing, keeping my love for radio and music as a first love hobby.  Since my retirement in 2003, that hobby has taken on a life of it’s own. \n\nIt began on the internet in earnest with a simple podcast of music and talk recorded in my home studio in 2006 – and things took off from there.  Since then, shows have been on the air in China (a story for another time), throughout the UK, the US, New Zealand, Australia and of course, Canada.  Over the years the Radio Action team has entertained, informed and communicated with thousands of listeners – and the numbers continue to increase. \n\nAfter hearing the very first podcast, my good friend and long time work colleague Al Murphy contacted me asking how he could become a part of this little enterprise.  Suffice it to say, Al has been an integral part of the Radio Action team since the very beginning.  Listen for him on all our programs. \n\nWhere and when will it end?  Who knows, but now into my 70’s, I do contemplate days of sun, sand and cool refreshments – with the great sound of the 60’s, 70’s and 80’s on my portable radio.  But until that happens, I will continue to spin the tunes – a little platter, a little chatter – from Radio Action.\n\nThanks to all for making retirement so much fun. Cheers for now."

He has fond memories of playing drums throughout his school years and his love of music comes from his father, as he recalls his Dad playing records and dancing with his mother in their living room. \n\nMike’s interest in radio began when he was a teenager. He would attend live radio remotes in the Detroit area and dreamed about becoming a Rock and Roll DJ. \n\nAbout 20 years ago Mike’s dream came true when he began radio broadcasting as a guest DJ on several live radio shows in Detroit and had the opportunity to be a part of David Washington’s Twenty Grand Revue on WPON. It was on David’s show where Keith’s and Mike’s paths crossed. Keith was a regular call in correspondent from the UK. \n\nFrom there Keith and Mike developed a friendship and co-founded the UK USA Soul Connection, now the UK USA Rock n Soul Connection a syndicated international radio show that airs on the internet and FM stations all over the world. \n\nIn addition, Mike continues as a guest DJ on the Elvis and Buddy Holly tribute shows on live radio in Detroit with his good friend and long time DJ Jimmy James."

In 2007 he was invited to visit the station and was a guest DJ on Jukebox Classics with Bel Air Bill and Howling Harry. He formed close friendships with them and several other DJs in Detroit. Luckily for Keith, his visit coincided with the Indycar Grand Prix of Detroit. \n\nSubsequently, Keith teamed up with Mike Kroll and formed what he considers a great association by co-founding “The UK USA Rock n Soul Connection” playing the sort of music they love to hear. It has been a very successful collaboration and they hope it will continue for some time to come. \n\nThe UK USA Rock n Soul Connection show can now be heard on over 40 internet and FM radio stations around the world with thousands of listeners. \n\nKeith also has his own slot on the Flashback 70’s show on Krushnation, broadcasting on the internet out of Detroit.
